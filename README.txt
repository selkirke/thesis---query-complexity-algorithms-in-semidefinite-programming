Each of these individual files explore different concepts in Quantum Query Complexity Algorithms.
- Deutsch.py is a reformulation of the Deutsch algorithm as a Semi-Definite Programming probem and determines feasbility through optimization.
- Jozsa.py is a reformulation of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm as a Semi-Definite Programming probem and determines feasbility through optimization.
- Noise.py induces noise into the system and explores a variety of how noise affects different operations throughout the algorithm.
